# Chatemo

## 🚀 Introduction

[Chatemo](http://www.chatemo.chat/) is an innovative team communication app that seamlessly integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve problems in real time. In Chatemo, you don't need to switch contexts to ask questions. Instead, various models and agents (with tailored prompts) are available directly in the conversation window. Simply provide the API keys from your preferred providers to get started.

### 🌟 Core Features

1. **AI-Enhanced Team Discussions**  
   Effortlessly call on AI assistance at any point in your conversations, ensuring valuable insights and information are always at your fingertips.

2. **Multi-Model Flexibility**  
   Support for multiple LLMs within the same communication context allows users to manage their own API keys and utilize preferred models based on specific needs.

3. **Customizable AI Agents**  
   Easily configure and manage AI agents tailored to your requirements. These agents can be utilized with any model across all communications and channels.

4. **Collaborative AI Ecosystem**  
   Various AI agents work together, each specializing in different tasks, allowing teams to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems effectively.

5. **Context-Aware AI Interactions**  
   Experience two types of AI behaviors: direct communication for focused, immediate responses, and channel mode, where AI agents consider message history for nuanced, context-aware assistance.

6. **Preview and Fine-Tune**  
   Use Chatemo's preview mode to fine-tune AI responses for agent configurations and chat contexts before deployment, ensuring optimal alignment with team expectations.
