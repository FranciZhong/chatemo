# Preview Mode in Chats

Welcome to **Preview Mode** – your personal testing ground in Chatemo! Whether you're fine-tuning your agent, comparing models, or just making sure your message to your boss doesn't sound like it was written by a robot (even though it kinda was), Preview Mode has got your back.

## Why Use Preview Mode?

- **Test Agent Behavior**: Want to see if your agent behaves like the genius assistant you envisioned? Preview Mode lets you check if your prompts and configurations are working as expected. No more surprises!
- **Compare Models**: It’s like a model beauty pageant. Try out different models and see which one wins the crown for your specific task.
- **Polish Your Words**: Need to sound extra professional? Or maybe just a little less robotic? Preview Mode lets you refine your messages before sending them to your boss (or anyone else who might judge your grammar).
- **Stay in Context**: No need to jump between windows or tabs. Test everything right where you are, like a multitasking ninja.
- **No Long-Term Commitment**: Unlike ChatGPT, Chatemo’s Preview Mode doesn’t store chat sessions. It’s like a one-night stand for your chats – fun, useful, but no strings attached.

## How to Use Preview Mode

- **Blast Off!**: Click the **rocket button** at the top of your chat editor to launch Preview Mode. From this point on, everything you type goes straight to the model or agent. No pressure, but they’re judging you.
- **Abort Mission**: When you’re done testing, click the **cross button** to close Preview Mode. Easy peasy.
- **Model-Hopping**: Feel free to switch between models mid-session. It’s like speed dating, but with AIs. Find the one that gives you the best answers.
- **No Memory Lane**: Preview Mode doesn’t store history, so if you’ve just crafted the perfect response, make sure to copy it before closing. Otherwise, it’s gone forever, like that time you accidentally deleted your homework.

## Important Considerations

- **Session Reset**: Changing the agent in Preview Mode is like hitting the reset button on a video game. A **new session** starts, and everything from the previous one is gone. So, if you’ve had a brilliant conversation with your AI, save it before switching agents!
- **No History**: Since Preview Mode doesn’t store history, it’s perfect for quick tests but not for those deep, meaningful conversations you might want to revisit later.
