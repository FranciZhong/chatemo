# Quick Start Guide

Chatemo is a free-to-use platform that requires only API keys from LLM providers. We support ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini. Simply configure the API keys for your preferred providers, and Chatemo server will automatically detect available models based on your valid API keys.

## Configuring API Keys
