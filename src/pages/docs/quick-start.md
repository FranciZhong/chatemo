# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Chatemo! We're excited to help you get started with our free-to-use platform. Chatemo is designed to work seamlessly with popular Language Model (LLM) providers like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini. All you need are API keys from your preferred providers, and you're ready to go!

## Setting Up Your API Keys

Let's get your API keys configured so you can start chatting:

1. Look for the gear icon at the bottom of the user sidebar and give it a click.
2. Head over to the "API Keys" tab.
3. Enter your API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.

Don't worry – your API keys are kept private and are only accessible to you. If you're working with a team, each member will need to set up their own keys for LLM interactions.

Pro tip: Once your API keys are validated, you'll see available models in the model switch button across all chat contexts.

## Creating Your First Channel

Channels are where the magic happens – they're the main chatting spaces for your team. Here's how to create one:

1. Click on the channel tab in the sidebar to see your channel list.
2. Ready to create a new channel? You've got two options:
   - Click the plus button in the sidebar, or
   - Click the plus button near your avatar at the bottom.

3. Now you can either search for public channels to join or create your very own.
   (Just remember, private channels play hide and seek – they're not searchable!)
