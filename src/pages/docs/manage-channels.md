# Manage Your Channel

Channels are the core of team communication and integration with agents and LLMs in Chatemo. They serve as a central hub for collaboration, whether it's within a private team or a public community. You can create your first channel by following our [Quick Start Guide](quick-start). Channels can be either private (for teams or personal use) or public (for communities). You can update a channel's availability at any time without affecting its history or current members.

## Inviting New Members

Once a channel is created, you can invite friends or teammates to join:

1. Click the **invite icon** at the top right of the channel window.
2. For private channels, sending an invite is the only way to add new members since they are not searchable.
3. Once the invite is sent, your friend will receive a notification in their notification box, where they can accept the request.

## Searching for Public Channels

You can also join public channels to connect with larger communities:

1. Switch to the **Channel** tab in the left sidebar.
2. Alternatively, click the **plus icon** near your user section and select "Join Channel" from the menu.

4. Hover over the search results to view the channel's meta information.
5. Once you've found the right channel, send a join request to the channel owner.

## Managing Memberships

To view and manage members in a channel:

1. Click the **members button** at the top right of the channel window.
2. You'll see a list of all current members along with their basic information.
3. Right-click on a member's card to see options, such as connecting with them as a friend.
4. If you're the channel owner, you'll have additional options like removing members or granting ownership to another user.

## Leaving or Closing a Channel

If you decide to leave a channel:

1. Right-click (or double-click with a trackpad) on the channel name in the left sidebar.
2. Select the **Leave Channel** option.

**Important**: If you're the channel owner, you must either:

- Grant ownership to another member before leaving, or
- Close the channel entirely, which will remove all history and memberships.
